  Chaining commands to avoid saving intermediary output is common practice in many programming languages.
  Using a pipe (” |> "), this tutorial covers how pipes can improve your workflow, and make it more readable.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(tidyquintro)
library(learnr)
library(gradethis)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,
                 exercise.warn_invisible = FALSE)

# enable code checking
tutorial_options(exercise.checker = grade_learnr)
```

## Piping the commands

Alter the code so that instead of being a standard R command, that the data is piped into the command instead. 

```{r pipe1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
filter(penguins, species == "Gentoo")
```

```{r pipe1-solution}
penguins |> filter(species == "Gentoo")
```

```{r pipe1-check}
grade_code(
  correct = random_praise(),
  incorrect = random_encouragement()
)
```

```{r pipe1-hint-1}
enter the dataset first then pipe ` |> ` into the filter function, excluding the data set name inside the filter
```


### Chain the commands
Alter the code below so that rather than being two distinct function calls, they are piped into each other.

Alter the code so that instead of being a standard R command, that the data is piped into the command instead. 

```{r pipe2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 6}
penguins |> 
  filter(species == "Gentoo")

penguins |> 
  select(species, contains("bill"))
```

```{r pipe2-solution}
penguins |> 
  filter(species == "Gentoo") |> 
  select(species, contains("bill"))
```

```{r pipe2-check}
grade_code(
  correct = random_praise(),
  incorrect = random_encouragement()
)
```
